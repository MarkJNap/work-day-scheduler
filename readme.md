# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For creating a work day scheduler I had to take some initial code and use my knowledge of Day.js and jQuery to display time, update css and save information locally. A work day scheduler is a very important tool for those who have a busy day and need to keep on track with tasks, this project also has me using third party API's which is a very important skill in the workplace. The process of making this app was pretty straightforward and seemed to flow very easily and helped me gain confidence in that I was really showing an understanding in how to use and learn about these tools.

## Installation

No installation steps needed

## Usage

To use this app, the user just needs to load up the webpage and add events they would like to keep track of for each block of time, they can save the information to show up again when reloading the page. The app also displays the current time and which timeslots are in the past, present and upcoming. As well as a button for clearing all the event's information.
